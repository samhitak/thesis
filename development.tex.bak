This Chapter has purposefully a very long title to illustrate how
\LaTeXe{} handles such long names. Now it is a good time to look on
the table of contents and see how this Chapter and also
Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} are listed. Notice that the number 1 in the
phrase ``and also Chapter 1'' is automatically generated by using
the command \verb|\ref{ch:intro}|, because we labeled
Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} `\verb|ch:intro|' by using the command
\verb|\label{ch:intro}| after the \verb|\chapter{Introduction}|
declaration.

\section{Initial Setup}
A few things here to start. And here as well, since we need to fill
in at least a line. Almost\ldots, there we go!

Notice that I entered ellipses after the word `Almost' above with
the command \verb|\ldots|, and not by simply typing three dots.
Compare the result here: \ldots vs. ...\footnote{Word does that too,
but lousily!}

Maybe some more words in a new paragraph. And more, and more, and
more. Furthermore, additionally, in addition, and so on. Notice here
that the word `Furthermore' was broken into `Fur-' and `thermore' in
order to fit the line---Word, as stupid as it is, would simply place
the entire word on the next line, thus increasing the distance
between words on the first line to fill up the entire line.

\subsection{Additional Structure: The Use of Subsections}
\label{sec:structure} We are in a subsection now (two levels down
from a Chapter). When we refer to $X.Y.Z$, we mean Chapter $X$,
Section $Y$, and subsection $Z$. We declare a Chapter by the command
\verb|\chapter{|\emph{title of Chapter}\verb|}|, a Section by
\verb|\section{|\emph{title of Section}\verb|}|, and so on.

The nice thing about \LaTeX{} is that it takes care of the chapter,
section, and subsection numbering automatically. If I were to add
another subsection before this one the subsection number would
change (increment by one). This section is \ref{sec:structure} and I
referred to it using the command \verb|\ref{|\emph{label of this
section}\verb|}|. I inserted a label right after the
\verb|\subsection| declaration by typing \verb|\label{|\emph{label
of this section}\verb|}|.

\subsubsection{A subsubsection}\label{subsub} Just for fun! Notice
that no number is alloted for such a low level environment but it
sometimes useful.

\subsection{Another Subsection}
And so on\ldots.

\section{Mathematical Symbols}
Let $X=\{X_n, n\in \N\}$ be a Markov chain with state space
$\mathcal{D}$. Throughout this thesis, we use the notation
\begin{equation}
p_{ij} := \P\{X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n = i\}, \quad i,j \in \mathcal{D}
\label{pij}
\end{equation}
for the transition probabilities of the Markov chain $X$.
Furthermore, we denote by $P$ the transition matrix, $P =
[p_{ij}]_{i,j\in\mathcal{D}}$.

When we wrote \eqref{pij} we implicitly assumed that the Markov
chain $X$ is time-homogeneous.

Let us also define $Y$,
\begin{equation*}
Y = (Y_n)_{n = 0,1,2,\ldots}
\end{equation*}
to be another process. Notice that the second equation does not take
a number on the right---this is the use of \verb|\begin{equation*}|
environment.

Notice that the all the math characters, $X$, $\mathcal{D}$, and
others such as $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are part of the text in
\LaTeX{}. On the contrary, Word includes such characters as foreign
objects (usually images), which increases the size of the document
file, sometimes makes them disappear, but most importantly are not
as aesthetically pleasing as the resulting characters here.

\section{Citing and Bibliography}
When working with large documents you need an easy way to cite your
references without having to go back to your list all the time to
remember the names of the authors and the year of publication. Even
more importantly, you need to have all your references listed in the
end of the document in alphabetical order. Of course, they all need
to be syntactically the same so that alone makes the manual entry of
references a big pain. Thankfully, \LaTeX{} takes care of that in a
very easy and elegant way, using \BibTeX.


I cite here a few books, papers, and technical reports, and please
go to page \pageref{bib} to see the resulting bibliography.

According to the books by \cite{C75}, \cite{BR02}, and \cite{MR97}
and the articles by \cite{DG01}, \cite{BBM05}, and \cite{CFPS04} we
conclude absolutely nothing. However, in his report, \cite{A04}
claims that otherwise. Blah, blah \cite[][]{AMM05}. \nocite{BBM05}. Figure~\ref{fig:dens} on page~\pageref{fig:dens}

The citations are included in the file \verb|refs.bib| under the
folder \verb|Bibliography|. You can modify it and make your own
references.
